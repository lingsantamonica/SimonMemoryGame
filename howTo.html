  <h1>The Simon Memory Game</h1>
  <p>0. Press keyboard to start/restart the game.</p>
  <p>1. At the beginning of the game, one of the 4 keys lights up randomly producing simultaneously a sound associated to the key.</p>
  <p>2. The player has to press the same key.</p>
  <p>3. Next, the Simon turns back the same light on and a second one, again randomly.</p>
  <p>4. The player has to reproduce this chain of light using his memory.</p>
  <p>5. And so on... In each round a new key is added to the series and the game becomes all the more difficult as the player's memory is put to the test.</p>
  <p>6. If the player doesn't make any mistake, the game goes on, so it is an endless game!</p>
